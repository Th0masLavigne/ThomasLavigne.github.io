It was designed to complement the resource “Introduction to Biomechanics,” which covers several important points of this discipline. The present resource is based on research work conducted during the authors’ master’s degree in biomechanics, as well as their master 1 internships, master 2 thesis, and pre-doctoral research year. click here\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction à la Biomécanique\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomechanics, in its commonly accepted definition, consists of applying the tools, methods, and principles of mechanics to biological tissues and organs and their associated medical problems. It is an ancient discipline, studied since antiquity, but it became established as a distinct field in its own right during the 1960s and 1970s. As a varied discipline at the intersection of multiple subjects and methods, it is difficult to approach this theme using a single method. Thus, this resource aims to present the main challenges, their associated analyses and measurement tools, and their clinical applications. It is therefore not an exhaustive list of the topics studied, but an approach to the scientific methodology centered around the biomechanical question. First, we will present what historically founded the domain, namely the analysis of locomotion and movement. Second, we will focus on the effects of forces and deformations on tissues and the biological processes involved. Finally, we will consider the, primarily clinical, applications of the developed tools, and their place and potential in the current treatment of pathologies. The resource “Mechanical characterization of a soft tissue: passive muscle” specifically addresses the process of modeling a complex tissue using the tools of continuum mechanics. click here"

The core work involves using experimental data to identify the material’s mechanical properties based on its fabrication conditions. A key objective is the enhancement of these models to incorporate the complex influence of contractile cells within the gel, specifically including their mechanoperception response. Further development will integrate microstructural information to accurately describe how the collagen fibers move and reorient under mechanical load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/2025-11/2025 - Post Doctoral Researcher ANR MATISSE: Simulation of porous liquids and HPC installations\n\n\nAt: Institut de mécanique et d’ingénierie, Université de Bordeaux INP, UMR 5295, CNRS\nWith: Jean-Marc Allain\nProject: The Postdoctoral Researcher will primarily focus on simulating the mechanical behavior of porous fluids (e.g., poroelastic models for fluids) using the advanced finite element software FEniCSx. In addition to leading these simulations, the Postdoc will provide essential computational and numerical support to four specific PhD students (S. Pastore, C. Cornillon, M. Laccour, and L.
